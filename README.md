# srmc

SRMC (Small Rust Math Crate)
srmc is a collection of mathematical methods, functions, and other useful tools.
The goal is to make a stand alone math focused crate that can be used for a wide variety of applications.
Will be continuously updated and improved as I imporve with the Rust langauge.
